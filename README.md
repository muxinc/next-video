# `next-video`

Next video is a react component for adding video to your [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) application. It extends both the `<video>` element and your Next app with features for automatic video optimization.

- **Smart storage:** Store large video files outside of your git repo
- **Auto optimized**: Automatically optimize video files and deliver via CDN for better playback performance and quality
- **Customizable UI:** Choose from themes or build your own player controls
- **Posters & Previews:** Zero-config placeholder images and timeline hover thumbnails
- **Wider compatibility:** Use videos that arenâ€™t supported natively by all browsers
- **Analytics built-in (optional):** See how often videos get watched and track video performance
- **AI-powered:** Whisper captions coming soon...

```tsx
import Video from 'next-video';
import myVideo from '/videos/my-video.mp4';

export default function Page() {
  return <Video src={myVideo} />;
}
```

## Setup

### Install the package

```bash
cd your-next-app

# If your project is using NPM (the default for Next.js)
npm install next-video

# If your project is using Yarn
yarn add next-video

# If your project is using pnpm
pnpm add next-video
```

### Run the init wizard

```bash
npx next-video init
```

This will (with prompting):

- install `next-video` as a dependency
- update your `next.config.js` file
- if you're using TypeScript, add types for your video file imports
- create a `/videos` directory in your project which is where you will put all video source files.

It will also add a .gitignore file to the `/videos` directory that ignores video files. Videos, particularly any of reasonable size, shouldn't be stored/tracked by git. Alternatively, if you'd like to store the original files you can remove the added gitignore lines and install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

### Remote storage and optimization

Vercel [recommends](https://vercel.com/guides/best-practices-for-hosting-videos-on-vercel-nextjs-mp4-gif) using a dedicated content platform for video because video files are large and can lead to excessive bandwidth usage. By default, next-video uses [Mux](https://mux.com), which is built by the the creators of Video.js, powers popular streaming apps like Patreon, and whose video performance monitoring is used on the largest live events in the world.

- [Sign up for Mux](https://dashboard.mux.com/signup)
- [Create an access token](https://dashboard.mux.com/settings/access-tokens#create)
- Add environment variables to `.env.local` (or however you export local env variables)

```bash
# .env.local
MUX_TOKEN_ID=[YOUR_TOKEN_ID]
MUX_TOKEN_SECRET=[YOUR_TOKEN_SECRET]
```

### If you choose to do things manually

#### Add Next Video to `next.config.js`

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const { withNextVideo } = require('next-video/process');

const nextConfig = {}; // Your current Next Config object

module.exports = withNextVideo(nextConfig);
```

#### Add video import types to `tsconfig.json`

This is only required if you're using TypeScript, and makes sure your video file imports don't yell at you for missing types. `video.d.ts` should have been created in your project root when you ran `npx next-video init`, if not you can create it manually:

```ts
// video.d.ts
/// <reference types="next-video/video-types/global" />
```

Then add that file to the `include` array in `tsconfig.json`.

```js
{
  // ...
  "include": ["video.d.ts", "next-env.d.ts", /* ... */ ]
  // ...
}
```

## Usage

### Local videos

Add videos locally to the `/videos` directory then run `npx next-video sync`. The videos will be automatically uploaded to remote storage and optimized. You'll notice `/videos/[file-name].json` files are also created. These are used to map your local video files to the new, remote-hosted video assets. These json files must be checked into git.

```
npx next-video sync
```

You can also add `next-video sync -w` to the dev script to automatically sync videos as they're added to `/videos` while the dev server is running.

```js
// package.json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev & npx next-video sync -w",
  },
```

Now you can use the `<Video>` component in your application. Let's say you've added a file called `awesome-video.mp4` to `/videos`

```tsx
import Video from 'next-video';
import awesomeVideo from '/videos/awesome-video.mp4';

export default function Page() {
  return <Video src={awesomeVideo} />;
}
```

While a video is being uploaded and processed, `<Video>` will attempt to play the local file. This only happens during local development because the local file is never uploaded to your git repo.

### Remote videos

For videos that are already hosted remotely (for example on AWS S3), import the remote URL and refresh the page.
This creates a local JSON file in the `/videos` folder and the sync script will start uploading the video.

```tsx
import Video from 'next-video';
import awesomeVideo from 'https://www.mydomain.com/remote-video.mp4';

export default function Page() {
  return <Video src={awesomeVideo} />;
}
```

If the hosted video is a single file like an MP4, the file will be automatically optimized for better deliverability and compatibility.

#### Alternative

In some cases you might not have the remote video URL's available at the time of import.

That can be solved by creating a new API endpoint in your Next.js app for `/api/video` with the following code.

**App router (Next.js >=13)**

```js
// app/api/video/route.js
export { GET } from 'next-video/request-handler';
```

**Pages router (Next.js)**

```js
// pages/api/video/[[...handler]].js
export { default } from 'next-video/request-handler';
```

Then set the `src` attribute to the URL of the remote video, refresh the page and the video will start processing.

```tsx
import Video from 'next-video';

export default function Page() {
  return <Video src="https://www.mydomain.com/remote-video.mp4" />;
}
```

### Custom Player

You can customize the player by passing a custom player component to the `as` prop.  
The custom player component accepts the following props:

- `asset`: The asset that is processed, contains useful asset metadata and upload status.
- `src`: A string video source URL if the asset is ready.
- `poster`: A string image source URL if the asset is ready.
- `blurDataURL`: A string base64 image source URL that can be used as a placeholder.


```tsx
import Video from 'next-video';
import { ReactPlayerAsVideo } from './player';
import awesomeVideo from '/videos/awesome-video.mp4';

export default function Page() {
  return <Video as={ReactPlayerAsVideo} src={awesomeVideo} />;
}
```

```tsx
// player.js
import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

export function ReactPlayerAsVideo(props) {
  let { asset, src, poster, blurDataURL, ...rest } = props;
  let config = { file: { attributes: { poster } } };

  return <ReactPlayer url={src} config={config} {...rest} />;
}
```

### Providers

You can choose between different providers for video processing and hosting. 
The default provider is [Mux](https://mux.com). 
To change the provider you can add a `provider` option in the next-video config.

```js
// next.config.js
const { withNextVideo } = require('next-video/process')

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {}

module.exports = withNextVideo(nextConfig, {
  provider: 'vercel-blob',
})
```

Supported providers with their required environment variables:

- [`mux`](https://mux.com) (`MUX_TOKEN_ID`, `MUX_TOKEN_SECRET`)
- [`vercel-blob`](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob) (`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`)
- More coming soon...

1. `cd` into the repo
1. `npm install && npm run build`
1. `cd ../` (or back to wherever you want to create a test app)
1. `npx create-next-app`
